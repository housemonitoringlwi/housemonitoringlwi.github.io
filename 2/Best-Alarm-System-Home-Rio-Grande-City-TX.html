<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) occurs when a hacker has the ability to eavesdrop on network traffic and recognize the MAC address of a computer with network advantages Many wireless systems enable some sort of MAC filtering to enable only licensed computers with specific MAC IDs to access and make use of the network. However, programs exist that have network sniffing" abilities.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious assailant, because the interruption of the network prevents the flow of data and really indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being transmitted. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the destructive attacker to record these codes and use various cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
