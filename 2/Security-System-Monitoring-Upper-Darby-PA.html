Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and two monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester chose the Interactive strategy but wound up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance.
