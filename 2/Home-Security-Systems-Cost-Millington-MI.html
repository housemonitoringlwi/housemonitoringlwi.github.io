<p>Condo associations might prohibit citizens from drilling holes in exterior walls. Homeowners of these houses might be much better off utilizing a wireless security system.

Though saving the large quantity of information can be a concern, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software application that governs for how long the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage area, for instance.</p>

Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
