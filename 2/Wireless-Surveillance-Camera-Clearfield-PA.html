Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
