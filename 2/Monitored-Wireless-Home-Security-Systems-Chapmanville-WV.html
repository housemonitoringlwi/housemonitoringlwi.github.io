<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise require to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody!
