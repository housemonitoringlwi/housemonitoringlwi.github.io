<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space.
