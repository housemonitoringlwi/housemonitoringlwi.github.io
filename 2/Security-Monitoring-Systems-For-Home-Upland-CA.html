Since it doesn't utilize the rent-to-own model that's popular with the majority of security brand names, that's. If it does not meet your requirements, you're complimentary to resell your SimpliSafe equipment on Amazon or eBay. The customer service reps may even suggest reselling as an alternative to offering you a refund.</p>
