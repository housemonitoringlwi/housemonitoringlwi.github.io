<h3>Wireless Security Company in Millersville PA</h3>
<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks beautiful: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you picture a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This meant every door and window required its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Lots of security systems can add on extra security functions such as sound-wave and infrared sensing units.

<p>As to how water resistant it is, time will inform. I hedged my bets and siliconed the body joint and where the wire enters into the back of the camera. I have this mounted on the side of my rv, so it'll be tested. Due to the fact that you can manage all your alarm systems remotely from your smartphone or computer if you forget to equip your home security system it doesn't matter.
