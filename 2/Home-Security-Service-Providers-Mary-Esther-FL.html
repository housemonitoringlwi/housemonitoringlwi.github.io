The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
