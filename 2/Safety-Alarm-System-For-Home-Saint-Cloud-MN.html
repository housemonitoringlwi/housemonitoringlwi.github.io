<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
