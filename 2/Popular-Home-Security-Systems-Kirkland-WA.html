With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
