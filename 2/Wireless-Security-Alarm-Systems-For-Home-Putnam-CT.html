<p>These cameras can recording and sending extremely sensitive data," states Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Laboratory. That's why we check them for information security and data privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or someone, mainly to avoid or identify crime. With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the help of electronic monitoring and video recording. It usually involves connecting video cameras to an IP network or recording device and monitoring the feed.</p>
<p>IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an ingrained video server having an IP address, efficient in streaming the video (and in some cases, even audio). Monitored systems are supervised by an alarm monitoring company and make it possible for security personnel to immediately call the authorities in case of an emergency situation.

<h3>Home Security System Review in Connecticut</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gained quite the excitement throughout the years. We've been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you choose the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>There's a main 100db siren here too (silenced by the top button) which might be valuable if your cameras are all mounted outside - and doing so isn't a problem, with each carrying an IP65 score that indicates they'll stand up to a jet from a tube. For repairing, you have the option of either a strong magnetic ball install or a standard tripod screw.</p>
