<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too costly, and not terrific.</p>

These notifications can notify you to suspicious activity so you can monitor the circumstance.</p>

At SafeWise, we're Amcrest fans, and this wireless indoor security camera doesn't disappoint. Its remote pan and tilt function, easy setup, and range of video storage options make this one of the very best cameras offered for under $100.</p>
