We first observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
