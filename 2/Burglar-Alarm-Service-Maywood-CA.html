Surveillance cameras are cameras utilized to record the activity of the environment in which they are placed, typically for usage in conjunction with security procedures.

It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
