<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
