<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; everything within their focus capability is captured. That is to say, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it comes to isolating the images of an active incident about to take place. But you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to add to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
