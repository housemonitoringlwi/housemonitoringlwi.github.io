Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system.

<p>One of the top home security providers because getting in the business in 1992, Protect America provides service for numerous countless consumers around the United States and Canada. They offer flexibility in their equipment and readily available strategies, allowing house owners to pick the security option that best suits their needs. Regrettably, there are some downsides to Secure America shown by their low C- rating from BBB. A bulk of the complaints center around false information concerning the compulsory 3 year agreement. In fact, many consumers were not conscious they were making such a long term commitment. This, coupled with the serious charge for early cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may provide some time out in selecting Protect America as their home security solution.</p>
