<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year contract, however because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of three years, go with the contract and reap those cost savings.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
