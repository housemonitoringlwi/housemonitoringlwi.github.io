<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can utilize access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and smart hubs. A whole network can be lowered in this manner and require rebooting and even reprogramming of all smart networking gadgets.</p>
