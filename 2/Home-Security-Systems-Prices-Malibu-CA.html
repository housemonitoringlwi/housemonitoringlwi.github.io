These cameras frequently include two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensing unit. As with any security camera, have a look at the video resolution and field of vision.

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds pricey, however it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's center can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
