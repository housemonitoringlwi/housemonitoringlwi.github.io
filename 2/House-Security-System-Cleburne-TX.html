<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
