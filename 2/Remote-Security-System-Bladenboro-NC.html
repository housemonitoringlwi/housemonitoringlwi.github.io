<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
