<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
