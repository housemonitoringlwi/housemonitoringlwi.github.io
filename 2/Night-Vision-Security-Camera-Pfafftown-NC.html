The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are clearly not prevented by camera - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the minimal advantages that the system may supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
