<p>Firstly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the cost. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<h3>Whole House Security System South Hamilton MA 01982</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>

Alexa assistance is included, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera competently handles all the typical functions when it pertains to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights go out. </p>
