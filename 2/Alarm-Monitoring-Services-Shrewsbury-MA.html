<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
