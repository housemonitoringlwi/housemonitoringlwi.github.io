<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
