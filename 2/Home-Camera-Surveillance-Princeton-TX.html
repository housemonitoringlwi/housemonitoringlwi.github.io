<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

It will tape clips when it views movement (and a couple of seconds prior to so you get the complete view of what took place) and you can view these for a week prior to they're deleted.

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
