<p>Security: There have been lots of headings about hackers compromising home cameras, infant monitors, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so make sure to examine what actions has each maker required to eliminate this problem. Search for a camera that supports current wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and ensure it encrypts web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
