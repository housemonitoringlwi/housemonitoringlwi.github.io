<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
