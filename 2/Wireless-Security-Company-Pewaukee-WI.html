<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. When a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line.

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
