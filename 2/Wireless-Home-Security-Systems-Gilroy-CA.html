<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built files offering performance and setup information to make this combination work, there are just two choices.

The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
