So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print.
