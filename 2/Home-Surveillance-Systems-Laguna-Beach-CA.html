Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, wise lock, etc.), I wish to make sure that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home gadgets like lights, thermostats, outlets, and locks.
