<h3>Home Monitoring System in Paducah KY</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
