<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
<p>Commercial alarm companies that set you up with a bell that sounds when fire strikes will not be enough to secure your possessions.
