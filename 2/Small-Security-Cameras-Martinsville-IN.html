The privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera when you're at home and don't want to be recorded.</p>

However the large bulk happen throughout the day when nobody is home. Some burglars break glass to reach in and unlock doors and windows.

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. Numerous cities also require a permit to even own and operate a home security system.
