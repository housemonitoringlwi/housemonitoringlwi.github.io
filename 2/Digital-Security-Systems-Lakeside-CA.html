Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have in-home alarms.

<p>Cameras often transmit footage over the Internet, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location. In many cases, surveillance systems are paid for and run by the cities themselves. But in other cases, companies and homeowners share surveillance camera video with police officers. Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the pricier it gets. When you include clever cameras to any Blue system, and that rate leaps a lot.

The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you purchase a monitored security strategy, the same company that monitors the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically inclined, having actually a professional set up the system may provide you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- watch things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's initial acclaimed system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems offer impressive, reliable home security. With the newer system, you will pay more, but that higher cost comes with a system that is smaller, much faster, and more powerful. At half the size of the initial system, the small sensing units are almost unnoticeable. The new system works 5 times much faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to scare off burglars. </p>
