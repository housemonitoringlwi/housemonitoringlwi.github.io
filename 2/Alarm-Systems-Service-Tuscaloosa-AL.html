<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
