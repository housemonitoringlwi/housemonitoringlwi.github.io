Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more costly for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
