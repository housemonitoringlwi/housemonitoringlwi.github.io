<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
