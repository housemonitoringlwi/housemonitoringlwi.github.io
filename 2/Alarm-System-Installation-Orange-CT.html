<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. As soon as a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
<p>Costs for systems vary. Bigger systems that offer full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most costly alternatives. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most affordable option.
