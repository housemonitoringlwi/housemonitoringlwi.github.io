<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage option and others don't. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the gadget itself. This choice is generally cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video in the cloud.

This additional cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
