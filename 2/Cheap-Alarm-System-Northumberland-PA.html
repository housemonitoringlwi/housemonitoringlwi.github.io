<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face acknowledgment software application. The latter enables you to see precisely when a specific person comes to your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a wise smoke alarm and siren later this year, that makes this an even much better proposition.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
