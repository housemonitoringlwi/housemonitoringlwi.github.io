<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
