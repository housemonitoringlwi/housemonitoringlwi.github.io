<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
