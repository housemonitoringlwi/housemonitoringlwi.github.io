<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
