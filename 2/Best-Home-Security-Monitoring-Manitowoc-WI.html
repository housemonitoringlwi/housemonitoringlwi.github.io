<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
