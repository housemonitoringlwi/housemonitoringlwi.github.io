On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It won't work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely excellent, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might review this review.</p>
