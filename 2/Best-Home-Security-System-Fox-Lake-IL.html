<p>SimpliSafe can not ensure versus break-ins or theft, like most home security system providers (other than for ADT). Likewise, another possible drawback, because of their no agreement function, they need you to acquire their equipment upfront. And it is important to know that SimpliSafe's outdoor and indoor cameras options are restricted, using just one indoor camera with minimal capabilities. The huge 3 smarthome hubs (Alexa, Assistant, and Siri) will link just great with SimpliSafe, however, not all third-party devices will link.</p>
