<h2>Advance Intelligent Video Surveillance System (AIVSS) Middleburg</h2>
<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in development. We have actually seen enhancements during our brief time with the battery-operated camera, but we simply can't suggest a $200 camera that does not provide the ability to zoom video and will not have the ability to hold up against outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep an eye on your home, office, or store with our video surveillance systems.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the patio by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Notifies: Home security cameras push notifications to your smartphone when they detect events. Without seeing the live feed all day, this is the only method to keep tabs on your home in relative real time. Depending on the camera, it might send text informs when it spots motion, noise, a face (recognized or unrecognized), or all three. Some can send out notifies to multiple people, typically anybody else in the household using that product's app; others will send out e-mails in addition to text messages as a failsafe in the event you can't access your mobile phone. </p>
