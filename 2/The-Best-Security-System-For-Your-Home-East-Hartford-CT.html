Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.

Despite a general improvement in wireless innovation, there appear to be fewer methods for hardwired systems to be disrupted and paralyzed. </p>
