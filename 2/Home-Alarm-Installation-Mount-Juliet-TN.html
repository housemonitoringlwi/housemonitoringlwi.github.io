<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
