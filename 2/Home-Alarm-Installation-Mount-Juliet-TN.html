<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.

HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
