<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
