<p>IP (Web protocol) cameras perform the same functions as their analog equivalents, however with significantly greater abilities. IP cameras boast sharper, higher resolution images and more flexible functions like remote zoom and repositioning. They also give you the choice to view video on a web browser.

The significant disadvantage of IP cameras is their higher price.</p>
