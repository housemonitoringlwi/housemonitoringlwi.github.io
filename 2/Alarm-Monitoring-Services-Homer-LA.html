<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set amount of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term plan, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as many times as you want.</p>

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>

When the system finds a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security group and, in some cases, emergency responders.

And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems need to be able to do postures a significant risk.</p>
