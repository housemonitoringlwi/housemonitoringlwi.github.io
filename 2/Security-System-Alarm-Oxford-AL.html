<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and general motion.
