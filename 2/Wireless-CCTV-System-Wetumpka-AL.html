For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself.

Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and except a basic power outage, are more difficult to disrupt. Despite a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and paralyzed. </p>
