The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to save some cash - it does have actually a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to undermine for potential intruders. Definitely one of the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
