<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
