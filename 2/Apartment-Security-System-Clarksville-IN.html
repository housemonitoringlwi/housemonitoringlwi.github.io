<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is needed. There are just 2 alternatives if there are no as-built documents supplying performance and setup info to make this integration work. The very first alternative, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is unwilling or not available to supply those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
