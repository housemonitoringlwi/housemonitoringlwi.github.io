<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further wiring.
