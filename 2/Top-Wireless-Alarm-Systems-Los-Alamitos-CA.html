<h3>New House Alarm System in Los Alamitos CA</h3>
<p>We tried to find DIY systems that provided expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply free or greatly discounted hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people might want to sign up for service just for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>

We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
