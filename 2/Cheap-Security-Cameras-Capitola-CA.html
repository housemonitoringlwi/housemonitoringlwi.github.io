For even more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range concerns.</p>

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they occur often enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
