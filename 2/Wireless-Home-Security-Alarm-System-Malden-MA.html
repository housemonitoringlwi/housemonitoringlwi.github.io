<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

<h3>Wireless Security System Malden MA 02148</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite.
