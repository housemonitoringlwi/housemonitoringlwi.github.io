<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level.
