Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
