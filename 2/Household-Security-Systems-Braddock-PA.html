<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common.

With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly.
