Nevertheless, alarm pros say having an unmonitored system is still much better than having no security system at all.</p>

It's terrific for a car park or a storage facility, where the finer details aren't as crucial as the overall picture.

<p>Unfortunately, practically every wireless gadget can be a possible target for hackers. Regretfully, security systems are no exception. Similar to any crime, the crooks are getting advanced and are discovering new ways to get what they want. From new devices that can jam the radio signal and avoid the alarm from responding to stealing passwords to disarm the system; tricky burglars never stop trying.</p>
<p>It depends upon the size and layout of the monitoring and the home goals. The advantages of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity taking place inside or outside the home.
