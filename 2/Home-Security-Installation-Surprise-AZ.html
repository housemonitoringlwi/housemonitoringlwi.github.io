<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, police departments nationwide respond to countless false alarms from citizen and business security systems every year.

<p>The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.
