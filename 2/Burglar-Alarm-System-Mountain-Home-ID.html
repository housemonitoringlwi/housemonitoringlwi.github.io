A majority of the grievances center around misinformation regarding the mandatory three year agreement. In fact, most consumers were not mindful they were making such a long term commitment. This, paired with the extreme charge for early cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may offer some pause in picking Protect America as their home security solution.</p>

The sound may terrify off prospective intruders-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the authorities won't come till you personally call them. </p>
