<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Although FrontPoint offers a wide variety of equipment and home automation products at an affordable price, the one location where the company especially excels is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
