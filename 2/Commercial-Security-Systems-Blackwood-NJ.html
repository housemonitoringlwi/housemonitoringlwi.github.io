<p>One of the top home security providers given that going into the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for hundreds of thousands of customers around the United States and Canada. They offer versatility in their equipment and readily available strategies, allowing homeowners to choose the security solution that best matches their needs. Regrettably, there are some disadvantages to Secure America shown by their low C- ranking from BBB. A majority of the problems center around false information regarding the necessary 3 year agreement. In reality, the majority of consumers were not aware they were making such a long term dedication. This, combined with the extreme charge for early cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may give some pause in choosing Protect America as their home security service.</p>

If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the noise may frighten would-be trespassers-- if you're fortunate. But the cops won't come up until you personally call them. </p>
