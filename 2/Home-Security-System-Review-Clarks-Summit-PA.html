<p>Many full-time" citizens with alarm systems inform us that they are home all the time" and question why they would require monitoring.

Who will respond and hear to the alarm? And so on. If that system is not monitored, less than half the protection the consumer anticipates is being offered.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it finds an intruder; a handy intercom function that permits the device to serve as a clever doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>

Wired security systems are also susceptible to power blackouts.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
