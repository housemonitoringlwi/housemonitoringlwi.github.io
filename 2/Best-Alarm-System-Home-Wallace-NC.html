<p>The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image.

<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly attempted to give it an appealing edge, and we have to give credit to its ability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time.
