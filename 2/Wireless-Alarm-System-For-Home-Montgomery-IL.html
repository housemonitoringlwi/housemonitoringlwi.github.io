That indicates even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still inform you through your mobile phone if it discovers a hazard, however you are accountable for calling emergency services such as the cops or fire department-- so your phone requires to remain on and you need to be going to field signals, even at 2:00 a.m. It's good that the system has a monitoring alternative, though, in case you do not always desire that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
