<p>ADT doesn't have the greatest customer support reputation among the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 grievances on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this as much as the reality that ADT has a number of million more customers than its rivals, our tester started his call with low expectations.

<p>Rate: Smart alarm systems can be less expensive since customers avoid paying another person to install or monitor them. Incorrect alarms typically interrupt next-door neighbors.

<p>Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These individuals are $18 a month less expensive and stayed in business three years so I'm comfortable giving them a try. When my dealership folded, Dream I had actually looked earlier but frankly didnt understand I might conserve money until forced to look.</p>
