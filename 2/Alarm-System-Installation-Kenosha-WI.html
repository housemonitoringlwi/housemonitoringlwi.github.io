<p>If you're trying to find motion detection, the Canary Flex includes an intelligent version that sends alerts straight to your phone. This camera provides a wide variety of features including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the road. Not great, not awful, however with a really easy setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer feature when it comes to smart cameras.) This more recent variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most affordable monitoring plan starting at $10. You can get all the basics like e-mail, sms, and push notifies, in addition to 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's least expensive, Always On" strategy. However, you will need to spend for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) each month, and this doesn't featured expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't perfect, but when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take. </p>
