<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
