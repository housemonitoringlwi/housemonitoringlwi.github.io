<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
