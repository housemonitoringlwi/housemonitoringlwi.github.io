If there are no as-built files providing performance and configuration information to make this integration work, there are only two options.

The other method is to rip and replace, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
