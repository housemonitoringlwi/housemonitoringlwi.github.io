<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
