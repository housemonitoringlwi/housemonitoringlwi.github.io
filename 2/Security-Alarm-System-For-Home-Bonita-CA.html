<p>The Nest Webcam Indoor is the third generation of the popular Dropcam-- one of the first, and one of the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's easy to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up almost anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it connects with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke alarm, in addition to many third-party smart- home devices. But to really use the camera's features, you'll need to shell out $10 or more each month for the Nest Aware program, which provides you access to cloud storage, person detection and customizable activity zones.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
