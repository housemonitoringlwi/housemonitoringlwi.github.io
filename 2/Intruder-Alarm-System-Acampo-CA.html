<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of two piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or typically closed when under the impact of a magnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which includes a magnet.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to discover it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
