Innovation has come such a long method that Do It Yourself systems can provide the same level of security (and often more) with a self set up system.

<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I love the Hive View's style - definitely the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list.

<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run indoors or inside - you get a lot of versatility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is simple to install.
