<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
