After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.
