Although some companies provide complimentary or greatly affordable hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people might want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example.

<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is essential. There are just 2 choices if there are no as-built files offering performance and setup details to make this integration work.
