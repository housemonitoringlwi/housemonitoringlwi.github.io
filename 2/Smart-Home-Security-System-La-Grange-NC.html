<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life without a doubt.
