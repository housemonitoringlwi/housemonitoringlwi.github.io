It's important to buy equipment that can stand up to your local climate condition, be that extreme heat, cold, or moisture. Cameras are also exposed to anyone who approaches your home, so you should think about how your video feed is protected from vandals smashing the camera.

Since the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really switch on when it identifies motion.

Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
