<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
