<h3>Alarm And Security Systems in Brandon MS</h3>

<h3>Home Security System Providers in Mississippi</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
