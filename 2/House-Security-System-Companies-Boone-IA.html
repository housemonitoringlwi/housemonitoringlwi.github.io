<p>Video recording isn't a basic alternative on the majority of security systems.

<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to suffice to frighten trespassers in many cases.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
