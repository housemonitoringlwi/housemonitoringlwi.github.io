<p>Maybe this is no better demonstrated than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted just how much had changed given that he took on the role in 2014, with the development of facial acknowledgment, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and a lot more. Modern systems now have incredible capabilities", though these have produced easy to understand misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and possible abuse such abilities produce. Porter therefore noted that the Home Office and surveillance industry need to ensure just software and hardware compliant with relevant requirements, such as Secure by Default, is set up in public and private areas alike.</p>

Their timeframe for response in under 10 seconds, which we need to admit is quite impressive.

That is to state, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it concerns separating the images of an active incident about to happen. However you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to contribute to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
