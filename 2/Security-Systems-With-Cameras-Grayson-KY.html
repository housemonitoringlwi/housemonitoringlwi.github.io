<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we don't think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
