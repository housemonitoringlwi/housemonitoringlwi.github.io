<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of 2 piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or typically closed when under the impact of a magnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the style is normally open or usually closed. This action paired with an electrical present (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control panel to spot a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are very typical and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
