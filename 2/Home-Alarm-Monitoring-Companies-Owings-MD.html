<h3>Top Home Security Systems in Maryland</h3>
<p>Bullet cameras are one of the two most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and an unique look. This look is identifiable to almost everyone and thus acts as a deterrent to undesirable individuals. The hope is wrongdoers and intruders go somewhere else instead if security cameras are noticeable. That being said, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism because of their apparent look. Additionally, the shape of the camera is ideal for concentrating on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires multiple cameras if a user requires to see several fixed views. Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work inside or outdoors. They include a small lip on completion of the camera that adds weather condition protection and lowers glare.</p>

We first saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
