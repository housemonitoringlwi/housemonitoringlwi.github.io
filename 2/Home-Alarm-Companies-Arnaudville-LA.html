<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level police official in Washington, DC was caught using authorities databases to gather details on patrons of a gay club. By searching for the license plate varieties of parking lot at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the vehicles' owners, he attempted to blackmail customers who were married.

At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to be enough to scare away burglars for the most part. To hold and recover costs alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you.

IP cameras are the more modern version of analog cameras, and while the private cameras tend to be a little more pricey, they offer a variety of functions that analog cameras do not.

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even set off false alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen frequently enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
