<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
