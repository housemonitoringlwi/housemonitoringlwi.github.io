<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>

<h3>Home Security Systems Reviews in Alabama</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.
