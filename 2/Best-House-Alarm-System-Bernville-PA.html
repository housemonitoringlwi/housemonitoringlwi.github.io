It can be slow and awkward to use on occasion - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit easier to mess up for potential trespassers.
