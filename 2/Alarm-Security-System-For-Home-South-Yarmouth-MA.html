Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
