<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>First and foremost, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the price. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your wise outlets with your overall security system.
