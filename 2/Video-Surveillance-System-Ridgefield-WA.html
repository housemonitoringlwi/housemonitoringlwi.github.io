<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
