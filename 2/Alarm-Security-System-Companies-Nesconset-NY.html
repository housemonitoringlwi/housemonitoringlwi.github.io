<p>The other significant choice when selecting a home security camera is whether you need an outdoor or indoor camera. Outdoor cameras will often be built to be more resilient and able to endure rain, frost, or damp.

Luckily, I have actually tested out dozens of cameras and condensed everything I've found out into the list below.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
