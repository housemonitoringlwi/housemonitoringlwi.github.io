<p>SimpliSafe can not guarantee versus break-ins or theft, like the majority of home security system providers (other than for ADT).

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
