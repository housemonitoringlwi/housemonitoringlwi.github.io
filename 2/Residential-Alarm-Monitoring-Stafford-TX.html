<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you imagine a home security camera. The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its elements, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This suggested every door and window required its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
