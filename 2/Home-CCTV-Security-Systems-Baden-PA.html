Now, a lot of security systems involve a multitude of elements, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and crucial fobs, among other parts. But I also value minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
