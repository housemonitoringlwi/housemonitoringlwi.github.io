<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
