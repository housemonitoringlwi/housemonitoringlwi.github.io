<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
