<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was invented for homeowners. It should be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, when set up, is difficult to move from one place to another.

They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your house. The team will be able to reuse the existing circuitry if you've currently set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. Nevertheless, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
