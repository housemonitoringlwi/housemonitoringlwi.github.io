<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
