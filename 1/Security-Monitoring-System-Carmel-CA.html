As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
