We likewise like that Vivint offers you the option to buy your equipment outright, which implies you're off the hook for a long-term contract-- however that does need a significant up-front payment.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm has four intelligent modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Personal. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your area. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree broad angle lens that minimizes all blind spots and offers you access to a wider field of view than a lot of cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that permits you to zoom in and record details such as facial features in case of break-ins.</p>
<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is important.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to distinguish between a person and a vehicle, for instance, allows you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
