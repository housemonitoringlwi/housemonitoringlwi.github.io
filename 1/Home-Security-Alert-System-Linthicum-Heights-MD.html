<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>

And to be honest, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're spending for is primarily that huge name in blue. </p>
