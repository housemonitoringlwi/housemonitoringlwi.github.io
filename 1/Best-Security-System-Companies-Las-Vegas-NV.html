<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, however after reading this article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply wouldn't link.

Definitely not perfect-- but the rep apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>

<p>First and foremost, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the cost.

<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to approximately 20 member of the family. Nevertheless, shared monitoring isn't a feature available from all companies. If this is a high priority, make sure to look into the company's features or speak with a representative directly.

In addition, officers responding to these false alarms are not able to respond to actual emergencies or carry out preventative patrols.</p>
