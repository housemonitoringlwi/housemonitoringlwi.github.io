To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require cops reaction.</p>
