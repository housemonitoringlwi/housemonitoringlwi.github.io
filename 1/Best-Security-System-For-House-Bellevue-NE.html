So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Actually irritating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, since obviously they car renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
