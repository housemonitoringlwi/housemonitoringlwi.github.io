<p>The SimpliSafe Home Security System includes pre-programed sensing units that work right out of the box. In general, SimpliSafe is better-reviewed by clients than ADT is.

<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built documents offering functionality and configuration details to make this combination work, there are only two options.

The other method is to change and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Rates - Basic packages are $249.50 for the equipment and $29.00 per month for monitoring. The upper-tier proposal is $299.50 for the equipment and $39.00 per month.
