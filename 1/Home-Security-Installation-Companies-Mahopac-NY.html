Wireless Security Systems utilize local hard disk, cloud storage, or a combination of the two in place of video footage used by landline systems.

This puts less demand on your home Wi-Fi service compared with popular rivals like Nest Secure that record constantly.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.
