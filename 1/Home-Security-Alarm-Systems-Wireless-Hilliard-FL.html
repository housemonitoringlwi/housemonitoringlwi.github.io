<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam integrates two necessary devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds motion, it turns on its 2 powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Webcam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak with whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their actions.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If catching footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
