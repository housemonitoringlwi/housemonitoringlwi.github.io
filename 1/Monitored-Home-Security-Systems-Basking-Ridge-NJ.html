As far as equipment goes, ADT's uses items from multiple manufacturers, including General Electric and Honeywell, in its systems rather that self-produced gear. This suggests that clients have plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are normally smaller than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most excellent reaction time of all home security companies we examined. Their timeframe for reaction in under 10 seconds, which we should confess is rather exceptional. A note of significance, if you want to get the SimpliSafe app, then you would need to subscribe to the more pricey monitoring plan.</p>
