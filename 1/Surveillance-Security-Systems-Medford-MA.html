<h3>Outdoor Security Cameras in Medford MA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is between discovering and tape-recording motion. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it identifies motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a dubious wrongdoer was quick enough.</p>

However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to launch a wise smoke detector and siren later on this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
