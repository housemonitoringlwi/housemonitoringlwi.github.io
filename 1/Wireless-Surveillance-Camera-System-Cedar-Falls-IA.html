There are just 2 alternatives if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and configuration details to make this combination work. The first alternative, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unavailable or unwilling to provide those details) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.
