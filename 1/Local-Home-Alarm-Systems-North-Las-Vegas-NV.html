<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
