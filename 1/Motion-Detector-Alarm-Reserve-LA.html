<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
