The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
