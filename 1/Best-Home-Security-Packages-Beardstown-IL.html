<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the patio by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my hubby).
