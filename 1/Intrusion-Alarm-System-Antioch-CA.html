We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
