<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are plainly not prevented by video cameras - and might even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system may offer in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>In the past, a surveillance security system generally included several cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor.

Most customer cameras save data internally, on a removable microSD card, or remotely on the cloud.</p>
