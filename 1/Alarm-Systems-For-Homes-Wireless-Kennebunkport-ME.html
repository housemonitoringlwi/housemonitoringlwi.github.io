<p>The Nest Cam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the popular Dropcam-- among the first, and one of the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be installed nearly anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it engages with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke alarm, in addition to numerous third-party clever- home devices.
