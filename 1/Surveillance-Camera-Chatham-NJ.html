<p>Since it's more complicated than it needs to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

Integrated sensing units get motion within the camera's field of vision and trigger video recording.</p>

In addition, officers reacting to these false alarms are unable to respond to actual emergencies or perform preventative patrols.</p>
