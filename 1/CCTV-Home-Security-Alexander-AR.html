<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically located in the entrance hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, clever alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly annoying your neighbours).

<p>Think of it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars? It simply does not accumulate. To use such low prices, producers need to cut corners, and completion result is compromised performance.

<p>Blue cameras work with Alexa and IFTTT only. Apple HomeKit compatibility coming quickly to all Blue cameras. For too long, the wise home hasn't been very wise.
