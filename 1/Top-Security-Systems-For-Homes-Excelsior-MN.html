As soon as any alarm system incorporated into the PCU was activated, the nearby camera to that place would be shown on that specific monitor.

If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can just enjoy one. This creates a one in three opportunity of capturing a specific occurrence on video (either live or taped). The command center also consisted of a computer designated for submitting occurrence reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database by means of the computer system network.</p>

We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months.</p>

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw great lines about 'Who truly is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side.

Most importantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
