<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

Although FrontPoint provides a variety of equipment and home automation products at an affordable price, the one location where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
