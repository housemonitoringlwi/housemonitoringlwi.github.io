<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are believed to be most effective, which usually includes highly inhabited towns, city centers, car parks, or numerous other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the positioning of these cameras is extremely essential, the crime patterns in locations of interest are usually studied for periods of time to determine criminal offense hotspots where cameras might potentially be put.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
