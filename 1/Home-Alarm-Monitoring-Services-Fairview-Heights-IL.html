If you're worried about personal privacy and would rather not store your video in the cloud, look for a camera equipped with a microSD card slot so you can store it in your area. A few cameras will even let you save video to a portable USB or NAS drive, but these gadgets are scarce.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment pricing is super affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and monthly break-in and fire monitoring. The total installation charge alone was not cheap-- several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
<p>Arlo Pro 2 also has a remarkable Night Vision function. It is geared up with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of visibility during the night. As such, even if somebody breaks into your home in complete darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your smartphone app. The only problem here is that the tape-recorded video will be white and black and a little dark so you may not be able to see details plainly.</p>
