<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
