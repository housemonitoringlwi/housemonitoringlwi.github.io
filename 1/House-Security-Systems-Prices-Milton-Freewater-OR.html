Some systems save taped video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others provide cloud storage. Locally stored video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a spending plan, but you need to be careful not to overwrite video you might need later on. Cloud storage makes it easy to store and access taped video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars per year depending on your subscription.
