<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
