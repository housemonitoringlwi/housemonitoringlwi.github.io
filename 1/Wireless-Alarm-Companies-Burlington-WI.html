<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious aggressor, because the interruption of the network prevents the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures data by avoiding it from being transferred. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the destructive aggressor to tape-record these codes and use different cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security crucial recorded during the network healing.</p>
