<h3>Monitored Home Alarm Systems Bridgeport TX 76426</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm system has 4 intelligent modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Personal. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your location. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that lessens all blind areas and provides you access to a larger field of vision than a lot of cameras. It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that permits you to focus and catch details such as facial features in case of burglaries.</p>

We didn't go that far, but we were able to tackle 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to locations in the kitchen and dining-room. </p>
