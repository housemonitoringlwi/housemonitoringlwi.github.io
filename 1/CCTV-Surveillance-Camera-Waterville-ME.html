<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires.
