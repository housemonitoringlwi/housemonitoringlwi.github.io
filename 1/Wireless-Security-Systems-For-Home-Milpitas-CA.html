<p>Due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be conserved directly to a computer, these cameras do not require a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be used up versus the quality of picture required or wanted). The greatest photo quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
