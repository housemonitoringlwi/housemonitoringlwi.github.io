<p>After ordering, installing, and utilizing these systems for 8 months, we discovered 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all supply an impressive client experience and intuitive, ingenious security tech. We 'd be comfortable equipping our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific location.

Though keeping the large amount of data can be a concern, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software application that governs for how long the video is kept, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to save storage area, for instance.</p>
<p>Despite being an established market giant, we were pleasantly shocked by the level of care we received from customer care. We were especially impressed with the customizability alternatives. Customers can select anything from standard monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the best mix of services and gizmos to fit their needs. </p>
