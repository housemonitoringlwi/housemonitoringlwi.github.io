<p>Thank you guys for the help, what excellent customer servcie you use. I ordered a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am pretty helpful to install it myself. I called in for some technical aid and they were pleasant and got right to the point of me shooting up the system when it came to the last setup. They even called back, the next day to inspect that everything was still on track.</p>

<h3>Security House System in Mountain City TN</h3>
<p>Another wireless camera setup, this Zosi 8-channel system records completely HD and includes 4 weatherproof cameras that can be attached outside to walls. And if you wish to add more cameras - both bullet and dome ranges - you can include another four to the setup in total. Not all of home security systems include a camera.

<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>
<p>Lots of video systems are simply recorders. KastleVideo is clever. Now, through advances in analytics, you can set guidelines for what you appreciate most.

<p>We don't hide equipment costs by rolling them into a high monthly rate. At Smith Thompson Security our company believe the ideal thing to do is, is to show you the price of the equipment and monitoring rate separately. That method you REALLY know what you're investing. Even if you take advantage of our 12 months same as money funding alternative, when it's paid off, all you have left is our low month-to-month monitoring rate.</p>

<p>You can configure it to capture anything from a practical field of vision right up to a full 180-degree fish-eye, which HDR picture features significant colour depth as well.
