<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. However while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously restricts your choices for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party wise home gadgets like lights, thermostats, locks, and outlets.

It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer care experience differs commonly depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
