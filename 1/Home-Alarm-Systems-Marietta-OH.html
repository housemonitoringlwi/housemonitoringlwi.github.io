<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>You and nearly 8 million customers around the country understand you can depend on ADT monitoring to help safeguard your home. No issues, you can still view multiple rooms from your phone and remain apprised of the situation in different spaces.

Secure America control board work with ZigBee and Z-Wave devices, Google Home, Amazon Alexa and other home automation technologies.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security area. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer support experience differs widely depending on the dealership you go with. </p>
