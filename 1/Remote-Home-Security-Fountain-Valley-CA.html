<p>Spend some time to check out online reviews and not just those on the company's website. Look at the Better Business Bureau website specifically. If a consumer has actually a lodged a problem about the company, its staff, or its equipment, it will be on that website. Other third-party reviews websites need to be inspected as well. Consider asking neighbors for recommendations on security systems too. They may even suggest a local company with a strong credibility that can expertly install the equipment.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
