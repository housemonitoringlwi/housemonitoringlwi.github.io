We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
