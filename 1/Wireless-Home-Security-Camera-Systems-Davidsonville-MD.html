<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was detected. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
