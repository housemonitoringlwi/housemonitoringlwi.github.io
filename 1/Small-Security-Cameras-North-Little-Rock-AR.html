<p>The arguments for and against CCTV cameras listed below are purely examples of remarks that have been debated, and are not designed to duplicate views from IFSEC International and its group. Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand new Arlo Pro 3, which delivers a comparable bundle but with 2K video rather.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
