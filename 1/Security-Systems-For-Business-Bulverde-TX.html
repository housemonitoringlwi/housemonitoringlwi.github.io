<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection gadgets are created to protect specific, concrete assets, such as fashion jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. The sensing unit will activate an alarm if the item to which the gadget has actually been attached is moved or disturbed.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
