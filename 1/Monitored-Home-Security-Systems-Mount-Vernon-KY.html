With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and could even set off false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm but you remain in a meeting with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get signaled until the next day? The sound might scare off potential intruders-- if you're fortunate if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the police won't come up until you personally call them. </p>
