<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
