<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
