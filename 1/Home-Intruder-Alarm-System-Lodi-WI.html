<p>On the surface area, these 2 camera categories might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the differences become obvious and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting becomes missing or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
