<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see specifically when a particular person reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).

Not to discuss that the client service experience varies commonly depending on the dealer you opt for. </p>
