<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
