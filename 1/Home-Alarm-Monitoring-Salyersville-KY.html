<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
