Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, however low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common complaints. Hardwired systems require very little upkeep, and except a general power failure, are harder to interrupt. In spite of a basic improvement in wireless technology, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and crippled. </p>
