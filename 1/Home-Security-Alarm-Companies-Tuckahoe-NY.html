<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just would not link.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
