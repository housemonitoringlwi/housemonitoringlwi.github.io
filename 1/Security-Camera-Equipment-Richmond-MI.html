<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
