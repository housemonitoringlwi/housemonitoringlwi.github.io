<h3>Monitored Burglar Alarm in Boone IA</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control board (typically positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been triggered, wise alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours). However, smart alarms do need a hub that enables the various parts to wirelessly link. However for a lot of wise alarms this hub can be placed anywhere in your home.</p>
