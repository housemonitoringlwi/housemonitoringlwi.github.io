Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
