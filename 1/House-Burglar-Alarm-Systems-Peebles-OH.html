Nearly all of the latest DIY and high-end home security systems offer support for voice control by means of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and sometimes Apple Siri, which enables you to open doors, modification thermostat settings, open the garage, and arm or deactivate your system with a spoken command to a connected device like an Amazon Echo or a Google Home speaker.

For example, you can produce an applet that states if a garage door is opened to turn on the floodlight.</p>

Flood lights can discourage vandals or scare them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
