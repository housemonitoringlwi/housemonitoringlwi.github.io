<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
