A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated individually and do not recommend for the majority of people.</p>
<h2>Securing The Attic For The Best Home Security Davis</h2>
<p>The main benefit of unmonitored security systems is cost. Even if you pay a professional to install your system, it will still be less costly than a monitored system since the majority of the cost remains in the monitoring service, instead of the equipment.
