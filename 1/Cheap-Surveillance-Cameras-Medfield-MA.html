<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is extremely affordable, so it's not a total splurge.
