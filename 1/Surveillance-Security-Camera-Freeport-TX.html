<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't included a free tier of cloud storage, so you need to invest a minimum of $3 each month if you want to conserve any videos.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is between discovering and taping movement. Since the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it identifies motion. If a wicked lawbreaker was fast enough, they might get past the camera prior to it had time to tape them.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is sent to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately.
