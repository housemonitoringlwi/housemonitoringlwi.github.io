<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If recording video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can select whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is normally done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is activated. However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer. </p>
