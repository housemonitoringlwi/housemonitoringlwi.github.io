<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire family will like. Professional installation with professional monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT professionally install and monitor your system-- you don't need to babysit or lift a finger signals. Over my 25 plus year career in the security market, I have actually looked into, sold, installed, and because we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, saw alarm signals for more hours than I wish to admit.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
