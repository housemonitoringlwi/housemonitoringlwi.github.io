<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store.
