<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyway.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
