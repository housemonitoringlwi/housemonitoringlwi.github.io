<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and typically difficult agreements, and frequently count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they use little advantage.

Similar to any innovation, the use of cameras is by no implies a replacement for good old-fashioned ground work. The camera footage supplies extra leads in an examination and aids in securing witness cooperation. The video footage functions as a complement to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>
