<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary. In reality, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to compare an automobile and an individual, for example, enables you to minimize unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
