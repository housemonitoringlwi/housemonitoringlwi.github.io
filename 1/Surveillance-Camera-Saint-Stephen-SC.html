<p>Slightly more pricey than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had been triggered. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false notifies). Nevertheless, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
