So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print.
