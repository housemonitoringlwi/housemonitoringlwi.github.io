<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are plainly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far exceeds the restricted benefits that the system may offer in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
