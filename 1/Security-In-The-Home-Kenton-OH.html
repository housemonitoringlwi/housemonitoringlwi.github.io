<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
