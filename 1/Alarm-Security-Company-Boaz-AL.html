We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). Nevertheless, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
