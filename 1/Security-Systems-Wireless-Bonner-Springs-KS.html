<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
