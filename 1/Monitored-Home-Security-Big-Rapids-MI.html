<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
