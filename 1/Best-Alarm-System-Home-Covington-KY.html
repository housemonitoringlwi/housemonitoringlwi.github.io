<p>The Ring Floodlight Web cam integrates 2 necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
