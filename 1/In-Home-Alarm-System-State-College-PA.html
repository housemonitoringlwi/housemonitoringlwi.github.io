Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
