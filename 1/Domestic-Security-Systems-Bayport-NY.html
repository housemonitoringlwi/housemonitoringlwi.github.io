<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more common.
