<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for catching a burglar in the act, however. They're likewise useful for casual home monitoring.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send mobile phone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
