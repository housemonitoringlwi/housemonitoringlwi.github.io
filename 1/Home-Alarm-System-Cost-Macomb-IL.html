<h3>Cost Of A Home Security System in Illinois</h3>
<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has actually gotten quite the fanfare for many years. We have actually been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you choose the totally free self-monitor" alternative.</p>

But what's best about it that it shows you videos in real-time through eufySecurity app, warns intruders they're on camera and has a built-in 100-decibel anti-theft alarm.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a little more if you wish to add additional functions, like a security camera. While a typical agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum contract requirement.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most affordable monitoring strategy starting at $10. You can get all the basics like e-mail, push, and SMS signals, as well as 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most affordable, Always On" plan. However, you will have to pay for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this does not included expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
