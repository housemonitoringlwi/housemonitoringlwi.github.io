<p>Up until now so normal. Things begin to get truly fascinating with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera detects a face it does not recognise, it will send a notice and photo to your phone, allowing you to consider that person the twice. If it's someone getting up to no good, the camera will follow their motions and save the timestamp, so you can quickly discover it in the future. And, naturally, you can phone 999 while they're still in your house.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester said the professional provided solid customer care: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
