<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the agreement and gain those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years. But if you might update to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
