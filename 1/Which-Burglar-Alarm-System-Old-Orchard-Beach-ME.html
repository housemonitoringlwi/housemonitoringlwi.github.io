<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is one of the very best-- and it will work with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera uses a much better field of vision than its bullet counterpart. It's also more subtle, more long lasting types of security cameras on the marketplace. If you're trying to find a less assertive security camera system, the simple dome has its advantages. All the security with none of the appearance of caution.</p>
<p>Put simply, security doorbells are simply small security cameras - wired or wireless - that include a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom gives you a wide variety of effective functions to secure your home or business. The videos your camera records probably won't be saved on the camera itself. Most home security cameras utilize cloud services to store and offer remote access to video Some designs have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to evaluate footage, however this is an uncommon function.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
