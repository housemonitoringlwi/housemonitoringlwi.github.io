<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
