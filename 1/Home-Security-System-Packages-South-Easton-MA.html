<p>The Douglas County Alarm system Ordinance supplies an equitable option to a difficult problem: managing our police assets to supply exceptional law enforcement services. With standard clever home devices like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for would-be plan thieves or talk with visitors who come by. Smoke, Fire, Carbon Monoxide, and Flood Detectors: Even though these aren't connected to burglars per se, they are necessary in protecting your home. Incorporating these detectors within your alarm system permits it to rapidly notify the alarm company and fire department of a concern within your property.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
