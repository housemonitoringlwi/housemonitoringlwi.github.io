<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
