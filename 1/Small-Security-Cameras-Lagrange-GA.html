Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.

<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is important.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to compare a person and a cars and truck, for instance, allows you to reduce unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
