<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year contract, however because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So select what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for at least 3 years, choose the contract and gain those cost savings.
