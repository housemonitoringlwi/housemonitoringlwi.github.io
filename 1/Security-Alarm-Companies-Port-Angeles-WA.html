<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not only finds that people have entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will likewise have a stab at identifying them too. Maybe more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must immediately understand.</p>
<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment rates is extremely reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

Appears like a much safer bet to us.</p>
