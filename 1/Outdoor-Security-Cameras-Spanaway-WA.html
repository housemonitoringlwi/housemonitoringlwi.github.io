Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment rates is incredibly affordable, so it's not a total splurge.

We must note that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
