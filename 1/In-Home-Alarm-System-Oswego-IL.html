<p>Contact among our security professionals with any concerns you may have about home alarm monitoring. While it might come as a surprise, burglar alarms have actually been around for over 150 years. In truth, the 2nd half of the 19th century was a duration of fantastic innovation in the security industry. The very first home alarm was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian inventor called Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
