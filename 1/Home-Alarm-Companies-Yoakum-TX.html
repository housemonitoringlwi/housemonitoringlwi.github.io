<p>Some individuals would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of buying a self-monitored security system.

<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

Some systems save tape-recorded video in your area on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others use cloud storage. In your area saved video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, but you have to take care not to overwrite video you might require later on. Cloud storage makes it simple to shop and access recorded video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars annually depending upon your subscription. Some systems provide both cloud storage and local storage, and some supply a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, that makes it easy to find a video event that happened at a specific point in time.</p>
