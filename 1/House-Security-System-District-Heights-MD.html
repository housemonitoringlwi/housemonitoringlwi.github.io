But I likewise value minimalist systems that elements that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
