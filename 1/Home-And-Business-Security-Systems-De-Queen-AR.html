<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular person reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. But Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
