It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision.

It can compare general motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've labeled (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
