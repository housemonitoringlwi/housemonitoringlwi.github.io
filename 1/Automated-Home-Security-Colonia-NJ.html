<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
